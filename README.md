# Custom C++ Deep Learning Engine

A high-performance Machine Learning library built from scratch in C++. This project is a deep dive into the internal mechanics of Tensor computations, Linear Algebra, and Automatic Differentiation.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- **Core:** Implement an N-dimensional Tensor class with efficient memory management.
- **Math:** Native implementation of Linear Algebra (Gaussian elimination, Matrix Inversion, Determinants).
- **Engine:** Building a Dynamic Computational Graph for Autograd (backpropagation).
- **Optimization:** Focus on Cache-friendly algorithms and SIMD (future).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17/20
- **Math:** Linear Algebra, Calculus
- **Tools:** Git, CMake (planned)

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Basic Matrix/Vector operations
- [ ] Generalized N-dimensional Tensors
- [ ] Automatic Differentiation (Autograd)
- [ ] Neural Network Layers (Dense, ReLU, Softmax)
- [ ] Optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam)

## 🧪 Current Status
Developing the core Tensor infrastructure and Stride-based indexing logic.
